# Project 2 Writeup

1. What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
   The useing of React hooks is very hard to use and understand.
   Using "useContext" in React is challenging to me, especially to understand and use it in a project.
   The "useContext" hook is designed to make it easier to share data across the entire component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
   The second part is the router to link each pages together. This tooks me long time to figure out the solution. 
   
3. Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make?
   With the limited time to finish the assignment, I was only able to finish the basic function of the project.
   I will finish the auto paly, longer lasting, and make the website page looks better.
   This will automatically progress the game, adn also I can add a feature to switch on/off of this function. 

5. What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
   While addressing questions about React during the project, I have few assumptions:
   The first, React is a powerful tool to careate a website. It will save people a lot of time to design and implement a website.
   The second, in order to learn and use React well, we need to understand the different kinds of React hooks well.
   The third, React is based on components and components help to make complex UIs. This kind of compoents based design is very helpful on code reusability and separation of concerns within applications.
   
7. How long did this assignment take to complete? (Obviously, this does not need to be a paragraph)
   1 week.
